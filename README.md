# Full Stack Open 2021 -  MOOC - University of Helsinki
 
This is the first part of the [University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

`Full Stack Open 2021 - Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.`


The course is split up into 12 parts.

Those present in the repo are my solutions to the exercises.
